Chapter 2:
Using a Web Server

Before you can start developing dynamic web appliactions, you'll need a web server environment to work in.
You have lots of different choices available to create your own development environment, but sometimes having more options just makes things more confusing.
This chapter walks through the different options you have for creating your development environment.

Recognizing What's Required
Just like that famous furniture that needs assembly, you'll need to assemble some separate components to get your web application development environment up and running.
There are three main parts that you need to assemble for your web development environment:

>> A web server to process requests from browsers to interact with your appliaction.
>> A PHP server to run the PHP server-side programming code in your appliction.
>> A database server to store the data required for your dynamic appliaction.

On the surface, this may seem fairly simple, but to make things more complicated, each of these parts has different options and versions available.
That can lead to literally hundreds of different combinations to wade through!

This section helps you maintain your sanity by taking a closer look at each of these three requirement.

THE WEB SERVER:
The web server is what interacts with your website visitors.
It passes their requests to your web application and passes your application responses back to them.
The web server acts as a file server - it accepts requests to your web application and passes your application responses back to them.
The web server acts as a file server - it accepts requests for PHP and HTML files from client browsers and then retrieves those files and sends them back to the client browser.
As I explain in the preceding chapter, the web server uses the HTTP standard to allow anonymous requests for access to the files on the server and respond to those requests.

There are quite a few different web sserver options around theses days.
Here are a few of the more popular ones that you'll run into:

>>Apache: The granddad of web servers, Apache was derived from the original web server developed at the University of Illinois.
It's an open-source software project that haas been and is currenlty the most commonly used web server on the Internet.
It is very versatile and supports lots of different features, but with versality comes complexity.
Trying to wade through the configuration file for an Apache web server can be confusing.
But for most web environments you just need to change a few of the default configuration settings.

>>nginx: The newer kid on the the block, nginx is intented to ease some of the complexity of the Apache web server and provide improved performance.
It's currently gaining in popularity, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with Apache.

>>lighthttpd: As its name suggests, lightttpd is a lightweight web server that's significantly less versatile and complex than the Apache web server.
it works gret for small development environments and is becoming popular in embedded systems that need a seb server with a small footprint.
However, it doesn't holdup well in large-scale production Web server environments and probably isn't a good choice for a web development environment.

>>IIS: ISS is the official Microsoft Web server. It's popular in Microsoft Windows server environments, but there aren't versions for other operating systems.
IIS focuses on supporting the Microsoft .NET family of server-side programming languages, such as C# .NET and Visual Basic .NET, but it can be interfaced with the PHP server.
This configuration is not common, though, and you don't see very many PHP servers that utilize the IIS web server.

As you can tell from these descriptions, just about every web server is compared to the Apache web server.
Apache has become the gold standard in Internet web servers.
Unless you have a specific reason for not using the Apache web server, you should use it for your development environment, especially if you know that your production web server environment will use it.

THE PHP SERVER
The PHP programming language began in 1995 as a personal project by Rasmus Lerdorf to help his web pages access data stored in a database.
He released the first official version 1.0 to the open-source community on June 8, 1995.

Since then, the PHP language has taken on a life of its own, gaining in both features and popularity.
The development of the PHP language is currently supported by Zend, which produces many PHP tools.

One of the most confusing aspects of the PHP server is that there are currently two different actively supported branches of the PHP language:

>> The version 5.x branch
>> The version 7.x branch

The first question that often comes to mind is: "What happened to version 6?"
The short-lived version 6 of PHP has some unresolvable issues and was officially abandoned by the PHP developers, with the new featurtes rooled back into version 5.

Now for the second question; "Why two active version?"
The version 5.x branch is still maintained mainly because of the great wealth of appilcations that continue to use features supported in versino 5.x, but not in version 7.x.
It will take some time before all the old 5.x applications will be migrated to version 7.x code.
UNfortunately, version 7 of PHP breaks quite a few thigns that were popular in the 5.x version.
However, the PHP developers are no longer performing bug fixes in the 5.x branch, only security patches.
At the time of this writing, the current version in the 5.x branch is 5.4 and will be maintained until the end of 2018.

At the time of this writing, many popular web server packages support both the 5.x and 7.x version branches and will give you the choice of which one to use for your installatino.
If you're developing new dynamic web applications, it's best to use the 7.x version branch; at the time of this writing, the latest version is 7.2.

The Php server contains its own built-in web server, but that's only intended for development and not for use as a live prodution web server.
For large-scale use, you must interface the PHP server with a web server.
As the web server receives requests for .php files, it must pass them to the PHP server for processing.
You must set up this feature as part of the web server configuration file.
This is discussed later in this chapter in the "Customizing the Apach Web Server" section.

Warning:
You may still run into some web-hosting compnies that use PHP version 4.
This was a very popular and long-running version, but it's no longer supoprted by PHP with security patches.
It's best to stay away from any web host that only supports PHP version 4.


THE DATABASE SERVER
As I describe in Chapter 1 of this minibook, there are many different types of database servers to handle data for your web applications.
But far the most popular used in open-source web applications is the MySQL server.

Many websites and web packages use the term MySQL Server, but there are actually a few different versions of it.
Because Oracle acquired the MySQL project in 2010, it has split the project into four versions:
>> MySQL Standard Edition: A commerical product that provides the minimal MySQL database features.
>> MySQL Enterprise Edition: A commercial product that provides extra support, monitoring, and maintenance features.
>> MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition: A commercial product that in addition to the Enterprise Edition features, supports multi-server clustering.
>>MySQL  community Edition: The freely downloadable version of MySQL that support the same features as the Standard Edition, but with no formal support.


As you can see from the list, the MySQL server has both commercial and open source versions.
The commercial versions support some advanced features that aren't available in the Open Srouce version, such as hot backups, database activity monitoring and being able to implement a read/write database cluster on multiple servers.
These advanced features can come in handy  in large-scale database environments, but for most small to medium-size database applications, the MySQL community Edition is just fine.
That's what's usually included in most web server packages.

Just as with PHP, the MySQL project maintains multiple versions of the MySQL server software. At the time of this writing, the currently suported versions of MySQL are

>> Version 5.5
>> Verstion 5.6
>> Version 5.7

the technical stuff:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------V
MYSQL AND MariaDB
The MySQL serer project has had quite an intersting life.
It was originally developed in 1994 as an open source project by a Swedish company, MySQL AB.
It gained in popularity and features, until MYSQL AB was purchased by Sun Microsystems in 2008.
However, Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems in 2010 and took control over the MySQL project.

When Oracle purchased the rights to MySQL from Sun Microsystems, the main MySQL developper and his team left to start their own seprate open-source branch of MySQL, called MariaDB.
With the terms of the open-srouce license, this move was completely legal, and the project has gained some respect and following in the open-source community.
MariaDB is nearly 100 percent compatible with MYSQL and is often used as a direct replacement for the MySQL Community Edition in some environments.
Any PHP code that you write to interct with the MySQL server will also work with the MariaDB server.
Don't be alarmed if the development environment you use switches to MariaDB!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^

Each version has some minor updates to the MySQL database engine but for most dynamic web applications, the differneces won't play a significant role in your applicatio performance or functions, so it won't matter much which of these three versions your system uses.

Several cloud providers (including Oracle itself) provide the MySQL server as a cloud service.
Instead of installing and running your own MySQL server you can rent space on their MySQL cloud server.
The benefit of running MySQL in the cloud is that you're guaranteed perfect up-time for the database, because it's distributed among multiple servers in the cloud.
The downside, though, is that this can get exxpensive and is only recommended for commercial web applications that require the extra server power provided by the cloud.



CONSIDERING YOUR SERVER OPTIONS
Now that you know you'll need a web server, a PHP server, and a MySQL server for your development work, the next step is trying to find an environment that supports all three (and it would helop if they were all integreted).
You basically have three options for setting up a complete web programming development environment:

>> Purchase space on a commercial server from a web-hosting company.
>> Install the separate servers on your own workstation or server.
>> Install an all-in-one package that bundles all three servers for you.

Using a web-hosting company
By far, the easiest method of setting up PHP programming environment is to rent space on an existing server that has all the necessary compnoents already installed.
Plenty of companies offer PHP web development packages.
Some of the more popular ones are
>> GoDaddy(www.godaddy.com)
>>HostGator(www.hostgator.com)
>>1&1(www.1and1.com)
>>000webhost(www.000webhost.com)

These large web-hosting companies offer multiple levels of support for their services.
Often, they'll offer several tiers of service based on the number od databases you can create, the amount of data that you can store, and the amount of network bandwidth your web applications are allowed to consume per month.
That way, you can start out with a basic package for minimal cost and then upgrade to one of the more expensive packages as your Internet application takes off!
It pays to shop around to check differnt pricing sturctures and support levels at the different web-hosting companies.

Besides these main competitors, you'll find many, many smaller web hosting companies willing to offer MySQL/PHP packages to host your applications.
There's a good change if you already have a web-hosting company you use to host your static web pages, it'll have some type of MySQL/PHP support.
If you already have spcae on a web server for your website check with them to see if they an upgrade to MySQL/PHP package.

With the popularity of the new "cloud" environment where everythings runs on shared server space, there are now a few more participants in the PHp server hosting game.
The Wikipedia web page for cloud service providers lists more than 200 different providers! You'll probably recognize the more popular ones:

>>Amazon Web Services (AWS)
>>Google Cloud Platform
>>Oracle Cloud Platform
>>Microsoft Azure

Each of these cloud services provides some level of support for PHP program development.
One of the main benefits of utilizing a cloud service is that your application is hosted on multiple servers that share the traffic load and are redundant for backup purposes.
If a server in the cloud crashes, your application will still work on other servers.
Of course, be prepared to pay a premium price for those features!

WARNING/ACHTUNG!!!:
Be careful with some of the smaller web-hosting companies.
These days, just about anyone can install the PHP and MySQL server software onto a server and sell sapce, so many "mom-and-pop" web-hosting companies now provide this service.
However, installing the server programs is different from maintaining the server programs.
Often, you'll find these smaller web-hosting sites use outdated server versions that haven't been upgraded or patched with security updates, making them vulnerable to attacks.

Building your own server environment

I wouldn't recommand it for a live production website, but for development work you can build your own web server environment.
You don't even need to have a large server for a personal web development envrionment -you can build it using your existing Windows or Apple workstation or laptop.

The following sections walk you throuhg the basics you need to know to get this working in either the Linux or Windows/Mac environments.

Web servers in Linux
Linux desktops and servers are becoming more popular these days, especially for web development.
You can download the Apache, MySQL, and PHP server source code pacakges and compile them on your Linux system, but unless you need the absolute latest version of things, that's not the recommended way to do it.

These days, most Linux distributions include packages for easily installing all the components you need for a complete web development environment.
For Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint), you use the apt get command-line tool to install software packages.
For Red Had-based Linux distributions (sucha as Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora) you use the dnf command-line tool.

For Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu, follow these steps to do that:
1. From a command prompt, install the Apache Web server using the following command:
2. Install the MySQL server pacakge using the following command:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Warning//Achtung!!!
During MySQL server installation, you'll be prompted for a password to use for the root user account.
The root user account in MySQL has full privileges to all tables and objects.
Make sure you remember what password you enter here!

3. Install the PHP packages to install the PHP server and required extensions, the Apache modifications to run PHP, and the graphical phpmyAdmin tool:
sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mode-php
sudo apt-get install php-mcrypt php-mysql
sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

The first line installs the main PHP server, along with the Apache module to interface with the PHP server.
The second line installs two PHP extensions that are erquired to interface with the MySQL server.
The third line installs the web-based phpMysAdmin PHP program, which provides a web interface to the MySQL Server.

4. Open s browser and test things out by going to the following URL:
http://localhost/phpadmin

You should be greeted by the phpMyAdmin adminstrattion window.

5. Log in using the MySQL root user account and the password you supplied when you installed MySQL (you remember it, right?).
Figure 2-1 shows the main phpMyAdmin web page, which shows what versions of the Apache, PHP, and MySQL servers are running.

Figure 2-1:
The main phpMyAdmin web page showing everything that is running.

For Red Hat-based systems, such as Fedora and CentOS, follow these steps to load Lamp:
1. From a command prompt, insatll the Apache web server using the following commands:
sudo dnf install httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd

The httpd package includes the Apache2 web server.
The executable file for Apache is named httpd (thus, the name of the package).
The package doesn't start the Apache wev server by default, so the second two lines use the systemctl utility to enable the service so it starts automatically at boot time and then starts it.

2. Install the MySQL server package using the following commands:
sudo dnf install mariadb-server
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb

Notice that the Red Hat distribution (and thus CentOS and Fedora) has gone with the MariaDB replacement package for MySQL.
When you install MariaDB, the pacakge sets the root user accound password to an empty string.
This is not recommended if your server is on any type of network.
Fortunately, there's a quick utility that you can run to change the root user account's password:
mysql_secure_installation
When you run this script, it'll prompt you to answer a few questions, such as the new password for the root user acount, whether to restrict the root user account to only logging in from the local host, whether to remove to anonymous users feature, and whether to remove the test database.

3. Instal the PHP pacakegs using the following commands:
sudo dnf install php php-mbstring php-mysql
sudo dnf install phpmyadmin
sudo systemctl restart httpd

The PHP server doesn't run as its own service - the Apache web server spawns it when needed.
Because of that, you do need to use the systemctl utility to restart the Apache web server so it rereads the configureation file with the new PHP settings.

4. Open a browser and test things out by going to the following URL:
http://localhost/phpmyadmin
You should see the phpMyAdmin login page.

5. Log in using the root user account in MySQL along with the password you defined when you installed MySQL.
Figure 2-2 shows phpMyAdmin running on a CentOS 7 system.

TIPS:
By using the distribution software packages for each server, you're guaranteed that the sever will run correctly in your Linux environment.
An additional benefit is that the distribution software updates will include any security patches or bug fixes released for the servers automatically.

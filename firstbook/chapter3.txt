BUILDING A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

When you're ready to start coding your web application, you'll need some tools to help you out.
Just as a carpenter needs a set of tools to do her job, web developers need tools as well.
And just as a the carpenter can build an entire house using a hammer and hand saw (and possibly a tape measure), but most likely, she has a few more advanced tools to make her job easier.
Likewise, you can build an entire web application using a standard text editor, but there are plenty of other tools around to make your job easier.
The trick to becoming comfortable with web programming is to find the right tool, or combination of tools, for the task at hand.
This chapter walks you through some of the tools that you can use to help make your programming job easier.
But first, I start by telling you what not to use.


Knowing which tools to avoid

Before I get too far into the tool discusion, I need to tell you what tools not to use for serious web-programming jobs.
These days, plenty of tools are available to help novice web designers create their own web pages without doing any coding at all.
However, trying to develop dynamic web applications with these tools can create more problems than they're worth.
Here are some of the tools you should avoid.

Graphical desktop tools
Graphical desktop tools allow you to create a web page using a purely graphical interface, without having to do any coding.
The most popular of these tools are the Microsoft Expresion Web package and Adobe Dreamweaver.

Both of theser tool use the what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) method of creating web pages.
Instead of an editor for writing code, the tool presents you with a graphical canvas that represents you web page.
To add features to the web page, you drag and drop elements like text, menus, images, or multimedia clips onto canvas.
When you've created the web page layout, you click a button and the tool automatically generates all the HTML and CSS code required to build the web page.
Click another button and the tool automatically uploads the files to your web-hosting server and you have a complete web page.

At first, tools like these may sound like a great idea, but they have some drawbacks:

>>You have little control over the HTML and CSS code the tools automatically generate.
Because the tools need to generate code for all sorts of environments and applications, the code they generate is somewhat generic and can be bloated and unnecessarily complicated.

>> Because lof the code bloat, it's extremely difficult to add or modify any of the code that the toold generate.

>> When you use a graphical desktop tool to create your website, you're stuck using that tool forever.
Just like other desktop software packages, graphical desktop tools often change features as new versions come out.
Old features are dropped and new features are added, sometimes forcing you to change the way you design your website.
You're stuck in an endless loop of purchasing upgrades and learning new features just to maintain your website.

>> The WYSIWYC principle isn't always accurate.
The layout create in the canvas may not always represent what appears in web pages for all browsers and devices that people use to view your website.

Web-hosting sites
Besides the graphical desktop tools there are also web-hosting sites that mimic that type of web page design .
Web-hosting sites such as Squarespace and weebly are oriented toward novice non-pragmmers who wan t to build their own websites.
These site allow people with no experience to get a simple static website up and running in practically no time, and sa you can imagine, they're becoming very popular.

These sites have all the same drawbaacks as the desktop graphical tools.
Plus, many of them don't even let you see the HTML and CSS code that they generate.
With these template-based sites, you're completely a their mercy.
You can never migrate your web application to a different host (which is exactly what they want).

WORD PROCESSORS
Some word-processing software packages, such as Microsoft Word and Apple Pages, offer the ability to convert documents into web pages.
This feature has the same drawbacks as the fancier WYSIWYG tools: You can't control the code they generate, and the code they do generate is often bloated.
Stay away from creating web pages using word processors.


WARNING/ACHTUNG
Also stay away from the tempation to write your web application code using a word processor.
Most word processors embed binary characters into the text, even if you save the document in a text mode.
This causes all sorts of problems when you try to view the web page in a browser.


WORKING WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS
Now that you know which tools to avoid, you're ready to look at the tools you can use to get the job done right.
In this section, I fill you in on text editors, program editors, integrated development environments, and browser debuggers.

Text editors
The hammer-and-saw equivalent for creating web applications is the standard text editor.
You can build all the program code used in this book using the text editor that's already installed on your computer.
You don't have to buy any fancy software packages or maintain any upgrades.
This section explains how to use the standard text editors that are found on most computers, based on the operating system you're running.

If you're running Microsoft Windows
If you're running Microsoft Windows, you have the trusty Notepad application for creating and viewing standard text files.
Notepad provides a bare-bones interface for typing text and saving it.
Figure 3-1 shows an example of writing HTML code in a Notepad window.
Notepad is nothing fancy - just your code in black and white.

FIGURE 3-1: Using Microsoft Notepad to write HTML code.

Notepad works fine as a programming tool, but you'll want to tweak a few of the settings before you start coding in Notepad, just to make things easier.

DISABLING WORD WRAP
In Notepad, you can define the width of the document you want to create, and then Notepad automatically starts a new line when you've reached that limit.
This feature is handy for typing memos, but it causes issues when coding.

Wrapping a line of code from one line to the next is generally not allowed in programming languages.
All the code for a statement should be on the same line, unless you do some trickery to tell it otherwise.

Another issue with word wrap is that the GoTo optino in the Edit menu becomes disabled when word wrap is turned on.
Because Notepad doesn't show line numbers, the GOTO feature is all you have to hunt for specific line numbers that error messages point out.
GoTo is a crucial tool to have in the Notepad editor.

To disable word wrap in Notepad, click the Format entry in the meny bar; then click the Word Wrap entry to ensure there is not check mark next to it.

Avoiding default file extensions

By default, Notepad assumes you're saving a text document and automatically appeds a .txt file extension to the file.
That doesn't work with programming code, because most pgrams use a specific file extension to identify themselves (such as .html for HTML files or .php for PHP files).

When you use the FIle -> Save as Menu option in Notepad, you'll need to be careful when saving your prgram file that the .txt file extension doesn't get appended to the end of the filename.
To save a program file using notepad, follow these steps:

1.Choose File -> Save As from the menu bar at the top of the editor.
The Save As dialog box, shown in Figure 3-2, appears.

Figure 3-2:
The Microsoft Notepad Save as dialog box.

2. In the drop-down list at the top of the Save As dialog box, navigate to the folder where you want to save the program file.

3.From the Save As Type text box near the bottom of the Save As dialog box, selet all files (*.*).

This prevents Notepad from appending the .txt file extension to your filename.

4. In the File name field, enter the filename for your program file, including the file extension you want to use.

5. Click Save to save the program file.
You program files is properly saved in the correct format, with the correct filename, in the correct location.

Seeing File extensions
In Microsoft Windows you use File Explorere to navigate the storage devices on your system to open files.
Unfortunately, the default setup in File Explorer is to hide the file extension part of the filename (the part after the period) so that it doesn't confuse novice computer users.
That can have the opposite effect for the programmers, adding confusion when you're trying to look for a specific file.
You may use the same filename for multiple files with different extensions.
Fortunately, you can easily change this default setting in Windows.
Just follow these steps:

1.In Windows 8 or 10, open Settings. In Windows 7, open the Control Panel.
2.In Windows 8 or 10, type file Explorer Options in the search bar and press Enter.
3.Click the icon for the File Explorer Options tool that appears in the search results.
4. In Windows 7, click the File Explorer Options icon in the Control Panel.
You may have to go to the Advanced view to see it.
After you open File Explorer Options, the dialog box should look like Figure 3-3.
5. Click the View tab.
6.Remove the check makr from the Hide Extensions for Known File Types check box, as shown in Figure 3-4.
7 Click ok.

Now you'll be able to see the full filename, including the extension, when you look fo your programs using File Explorer.


Settomg the default application
Now that you can see the full filename of your program files in File Explorer, there's just one more hurdle to cross.
If you want to open your program files using Notepad by default, you'll need to tell File Explorer to do that.
Follow these steps:
1.Navigate to the program file, and right-click the filename.
2. In the menu that appear, select Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. Select Notepad from the list of programs, and then select the check box to always open files of this type using the program.
Now you'be able to double-click your program mfiles in File Explorer to automatially open them in Notepad.

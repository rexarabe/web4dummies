Chapter 2 
The Basics of CSS3

In the last chapter, I explain how to use HTML5 to display content on your web page. 
However, when you juar uaw HTML5, things look pretty boring! 
This chpater shows you how to incorporate style into your web pages to help liven things up (even if you're not an artist)

First, I explain how to use CSS style sheets to style elements contained in the web page. 
Then I show you how to work with styles to change the color and font of text, make fancier lists, and spruce up your tables within your we page. 
Finally, I expalin how to work with the CSS positioning features to arrange your content in an appealing manner on the page. 

Understanding Styles 
When you specify an HTML5 element in your web page, the web browser decides just howt that element should look. 
Browsers use a default styling to determine the difference between the text in an h1 element and the tet in a blockquote element. 

Fortunately, another standard is available to work with HTML5 that helps you make your web pages uniques. 
Back in Book 1, Chapter 1, I explain how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) work to style HTML5 content on the web page. 
That's the key to making your website stand out from the crowd!

The CSS standard specifies ways to define the color, size and font type of text that appears on web pages. 
It also provides some styles for adding background colors and images and styling other types of elements on the web page. 

TIP:
The CSS standard has evolved some over the years. 
At the time of this writing, it's currently at version 3 - you'll often see it referred to as CSS3, and that's what I call it in this book.

Now you're ready to take a deeper dive into just how to use CSS3 in your web applications. 
This section walks through how CSS3 works and how you can use it to make your web pages look good. 

Defining the rules of CSS3
CSS3 uses rules to define how the browser should display content on the web page. 
Each rule consists of two parts:
a selector that defines what elements the rule applies to and one or more declarations that define the style to apply. 

The format of the CSS3 rule looks like this:
selector { declaration1; declaration2; declaration3; ... }

In the rule defination, there are five ways to define the selector: 

>> Element type: The rule applies to all elements of the specified type. 
>> id attribute: The rule applies to the specific element with the specified id value. 
>> Pseudo-element: The rule applies to a specific part within an element. 
>> Pseudo-class: The rule applies to elements in a specific state. 

Each declaration defines a CSS3 style property and its associated value. 
Each property sets a specific style (such as a color or a font) to the element the rule applies to.
You must end each declaration with semicolon, and you can list as many declarations as needed in the rule. 

Here's the format of the property and it's value as you list them in the declaration:

property: value

In the following sections, I explain in more detail the five ways to define a selector.

Element type 
You can apply the same styling to all elements of a specific type in your web page by specifying the element name as the selector: 

h1 { color: red; }

This rule ensures that the browser displays all h1 elements in the web page using a red font color. 

id attribute:

If you need to define a rule that applies to just a single element in the web page, use the id attribute as the selector. 
To specify an id attribue as the selector, place a pound sign(# ) in front of the id name:

#warning {color: red; }

To use the rule in your HTML5 code, just apply the id attribute value to the element you need to style: 
<h1 id="warning">This is a bad selection.</h1>

The browser will apply that rule to the specific element that uses the id attributes value. 

The browser will apply that rule to the specific element that uses the id attribute value. 


Class attribute 
If you need to define a rule that that applies to multiple elements, but not necessarily all the elements of that type, use the class attribute as the selector. 
To specify a class attribute as the selector, place a period in front of the class name: 

.warning {color: red; }

Then just apply that class attribute to whichever elements you need to style using that rule: 
<h1 class="warning">This is a bad selection. </h1>
<p class="warning">Please make another selection. </p>

As you can see from this example, you can apply the same class attribute value to different element types, making this a very versatile way of styling sections of your web page!

If you decide you only need to apply a rule to one aprticular element type of the class you can specify the element type in the selector before the clss value: 

p.warning{color: red;}

This rule apply only to p elements with the class attribute value of warning. 

Pseudo-element 

The CSS standard defines a handful of special cases where you can apply styles to a subsection of the element content, and not the entire content of an element. 
These rules are called pseudo-elements. 

To use a pseudo-element rule, separate the rule from the selector it applies to using a double colon (::):

selector::pseudo-element

CSS3 supports a set of keywords for the pseudo-element names. 
For example, if you want to get fancy and style the first letter of a paragraph of text differently from the rest of the tex,t you can use the first-letter pseudo-element keyword:

p::first-letter {font-size: 20px}

The fist-letter matches with only the first letter of the p element, as shown in Figure 2-1.

CSS3 defines only a handful of pseudo-elements available, but these few pseudo-elements can come in handy for trying special formatting of your web pages. 

There aren't a lot of pseudo-elements available, but these few pseudo-elements can come in handy for trying special formatting of your web pages. 

CSS3 Pseudo-Elements 
Pseudo-Elements         Description
after                   Places an object before the selected element content. 
before                  Places an object after the selected element content. 
first-letter            Applies the rule to the first letter of the selected element content. 
first-line              Applies the rule to the first line of the selected element content.
selection               Applies the rule to the content area selected by the site visitor.


TIP:
The after and before pseudo-elements may sound a bit strange, because there's no content to style before or after an element. 
They're most commonly used for placing images after or before the content in the element. 

Pseudo-class
A pseudo-class applies the defined styles to an element that is in a specific state on the web page. 
The state refers to how the element behaves, such as buttons that are disabled, check boxes that are checked, or input boxes that have the browser focus.

These rules are commonly applied to hypertext links on the web page to help site visitors distinguish links they've already visited.
You do that by using a seires of four pseudo-class style rules:

>> link: Applies the rule to a normal, unvisited link
>> visited: Applies the rule to a link that the site visitor has already visited.
>> hover: Applies the rule when the site visitor hovers the mouse pointer over the link.
>> active: Applies the rue when the site visitor clicks the mouse on the link.

You specify pseudo-class rules using a single colon to separate it from the selector in the rule definition:
a: link {color: orange;}
a: visited {color: purple;}
a: hover {color: green;}
a: active {color: red;}

All these pseudo-class rules apply to all the anchor elements in the web page and apply different colors to the hyperlink text depending on the hyperlink state.

Warning!
It's extremely important to list the anchor element pseudo-class rules in the order shown here, or they won't work!

TIP:
If you want to remove the underline that most browsers apply to hypertext links, add the following property to the pseudo-element style rule:

text-decoration:none;

There are lots of pseudo-classes that you can use to apply rules to specific elements in the your web page. 
Table 2-2 shows the list of avaolable pseudo-classes in CSS3. 

Many of the pseudo-class style rules (suh as first-child and last-child) work with the location of and element within the Document Object Model (DOM).
Book 3, Chapter 2, discusses the DOM and how to use it to reference elements on the web page. 

THE CSS3 Pseudo-Classes

Applying style rules 
In book 1, Chapter 1, I discuss the different ways to apply CSS3 styels to an HTML5 document.
To refresh your memory, there are three ways three ways to do that: 

>> Inline styles: Place the style properties inside the HTML5 element opening tag, using the style attribute: 

<h1 style="color: red;"> Warning </h1>

>> Internal styles: Use the <style> tag to define a set of styles that apply to the entire document: 

<style>
h1 {color: red;}
</style>

>> External styles: Use an external file to contain the styel definitions, and then add the <link> tag in the HTML5 document to reference the external style sheet: 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyles.css">

Note that with the inline style definitions, you leave off the selector part of the rule. 
Because the rule applies only to the element that declares it, there's no need for the selector. 
With both the inline and external styel sheet methods, you define the set of rules separately within the style sheet.
The great benefit of using the external style sheet method is that you can then apply the same style sheet to all the page of your website!

You can use any of these locatoins to define you style rules, or you can use them all at the same time!  
If two or more style rules apply to the same elemtn on the web page, the cascading feature of CSS3 kicks in. 
CSS3 defines a specific process on how the browser applies conflicting rules to an element to ensure everything happens in order. 
The next section explains how that works.

Cascading style rules 
As the name suggests, if you define multiple style rules for a web page, the rules cascade down from the lower-priority rules, which are applied first, to the higher-priority rules, which are applied later. 

TIP:
Saying "down" from a lower to a higher priority may seem counterintuitive, but it's common jargon ni CSS circles. 
Just remember that the higher-priority rules take precedence over the lower-priority rules.

The CSS3 standard defines a strict process for how browsers should apply style rules to each element. 
In Book 1, Chapter 1, I outline an abbreviated version of the cascading rules. 
There are actually ten different rule levels that the CSS3 standard defines for applying rules! 
However, most web designers don't use all ten levels to define rules, so things don't usually get that complicated. 

Table 2-3 shows the official CSS3 cascading rules process. 

Table 2-3          The CSS3 Cascading Rules Process 

Rule Type          Description                                                                               Priority Level
Importance         Rules contain the ! important property and override all other rule                        1
Inline             Rules defined using the style attribute in an element opening tag                         2
Media              Rules defined for a specific media type                                                   3
User defined       Accessibility features defined in the browser by the site visitor                         4
Specific selector  A selector referring to an id, class, pseudo-element, or pseudo-class                     5
Rule order         When multiple rules apply to an element, the last rule declared wins                      6
Inheritance        Rules inherited from parent elements in the web page                                      7
Internal           Rules defined in internal style sheets                                                    8
External           Rules defined in external style sheets                                                    9
Browser default    The default styles built into the browser, the lowest priority                            10


REMEMBER:
Notice that accessibility features have a special place in the cascading rule order.
Many Of your website visitors may have some type of viewing disability preventing them from viewing your content as you style it. 
Most browsers allow users to define their own style features, such as specifying foreground and background contrasting colors or changing the font size to make text more readable. 

Now that you've seen how to define CSS3 rules and where to define them, the next step is to start learning some rules to apply to your web pages.
The CSS3 standard defines a myriad of styles for you to use. 
Entire books have been written trying to cover all the different rules and features, such as CSS3 for Dummies by John Paul Mueller (Wiley).
The remaining sections in this chapter walk you through some of the more commonly used rules that you'll want to keep in mind as you design your dynamic web applications.


Styling Text
No place is styling more important than with the text taht appears on your web page.
You can transform a dull, boring website with just a few changes to the text styles. 
This section walks though the options you have available for styling text to help liven up your website.

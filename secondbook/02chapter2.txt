Chapter 2 
The Basics of CSS3

In the last chapter, I explain how to use HTML5 to display content on your web page. 
However, when you juar uaw HTML5, things look pretty boring! 
This chpater shows you how to incorporate style into your web pages to help liven things up (even if you're not an artist)

First, I explain how to use CSS style sheets to style elements contained in the web page. 
Then I show you how to work with styles to change the color and font of text, make fancier lists, and spruce up your tables within your we page. 
Finally, I expalin how to work with the CSS positioning features to arrange your content in an appealing manner on the page. 

Understanding Styles 
When you specify an HTML5 element in your web page, the web browser decides just howt that element should look. 
Browsers use a default styling to determine the difference between the text in an h1 element and the tet in a blockquote element. 

Fortunately, another standard is available to work with HTML5 that helps you make your web pages uniques. 
Back in Book 1, Chapter 1, I explain how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) work to style HTML5 content on the web page. 
That's the key to making your website stand out from the crowd!

The CSS standard specifies ways to define the color, size and font type of text that appears on web pages. 
It also provides some styles for adding background colors and images and styling other types of elements on the web page. 

TIP:
The CSS standard has evolved some over the years. 
At the time of this writing, it's currently at version 3 - you'll often see it referred to as CSS3, and that's what I call it in this book.

Now you're ready to take a deeper dive into just how to use CSS3 in your web applications. 
This section walks through how CSS3 works and how you can use it to make your web pages look good. 

Defining the rules of CSS3
CSS3 uses rules to define how the browser should display content on the web page. 
Each rule consists of two parts:
a selector that defines what elements the rule applies to and one or more declarations that define the style to apply. 

The format of the CSS3 rule looks like this:
selector { declaration1; declaration2; declaration3; ... }

In the rule defination, there are five ways to define the selector: 

>> Element type: The rule applies to all elements of the specified type. 
>> id attribute: The rule applies to the specific element with the specified id value. 
>> Pseudo-element: The rule applies to a specific part within an element. 
>> Pseudo-class: The rule applies to elements in a specific state. 

Each declaration defines a CSS3 style property and its associated value. 
Each property sets a specific style (such as a color or a font) to the element the rule applies to.
You must end each declaration with semicolon, and you can list as many declarations as needed in the rule. 

Here's the format of the property and it's value as you list them in the declaration:

property: value

In the following sections, I explain in more detail the five ways to define a selector.

Element type 
You can apply the same styling to all elements of a specific type in your web page by specifying the element name as the selector: 

h1 { color: red; }

This rule ensures that the browser displays all h1 elements in the web page using a red font color. 

id attribute:

If you need to define a rule that applies to just a single element in the web page, use the id attribute as the selector. 
To specify an id attribue as the selector, place a pound sign(# ) in front of the id name:

#warning {color: red; }

To use the rule in your HTML5 code, just apply the id attribute value to the element you need to style: 
<h1 id="warning">This is a bad selection.</h1>

The browser will apply that rule to the specific element that uses the id attributes value. 

The browser will apply that rule to the specific element that uses the id attribute value.

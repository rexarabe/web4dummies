Advanced CSS3
The previous two chapters show you how to use the combination of HTML5 and CSS to create content and style it for your web pages.
CSS3 provides some more advanced features, allowing you to do even more styling for your web pages. 
This chapter walks you through some of the more exciting features from CSS3 that you can use to liven up your site. 

Rounding your Corners 
In Book 2, Chapter 3, I explain how to build online forms using HTML5.
However, by default, HTML forms are somewhat boring, even after adding some CSS styling. 

The default styling used by browsers to display text boxes, buttons, and text areas in forms produces nothing but square boxes, which gets pretty boring. 
The original CSS standard didn't do anything to solve the problem, other than possibly adding some color to the square boxes. 
Cubism may be good for some styles of paintings, but that layout doesn't work in forms and can bore your website visitors. 

One of the features that had been hotly sought after in the browser world has been the ability to use rounded corners for form elements. 
The simple act of rounding the square boxes just a bit can liven up the form. 
Many individual browsers added the rounded corners feature on their own, separate from the CSS standard. 
Unfortunately, as you may guess, different browsers used different methods for implemneting rounded corners. 
Trying to write a style that would work across all browsers became both difficult and confusing.
But because using rounded corners became so popular, that feature was finally added to CSS3 as a standard.

The new border-radius style property allows you to round off the sharp edges from elements on the web page. 
It does that by allowing you to define the radius of an imaginary circle used to create the rounded corners. 
You can just shave a little off the edge by using a small radius value, or you can create a full ellipse by completely rounding all four corners with a large radius value. 
Figure 4-1 shows an example of applying the border-radius property to a few form elements.
